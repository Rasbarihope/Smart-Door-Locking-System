### 1. Include Libraries: This line brings in extra code that helps us use the keypad.

### 2. Define Password and Variables:

password: The secret numbers you need to press to unlock the door.
position: Keeps track of which number in the password you're currently entering.
### 3.Define Keypad Layout:

keys: Tells the program which numbers and symbols are on the keypad.
ROWS and COLS: The number of rows and columns on the keypad.
### 4.Define Keypad and Pins:

rowPins and colPins: Connect the keypad to the Arduino.
keypad: Sets up the keypad with the layout and pin connections.
### 5.Define Lock Pin:

Lock: The pin connected to the lock that opens and closes the door.
### 6.Setup Function:

pinMode(Lock, OUTPUT): Tells the Arduino to use the lock pin to send signals.
LockedPosition(true): Locks the door when the program starts.
### 7.Loop Function:

keypad.getKey(): Checks if a key on the keypad is pressed.
If '*' or '#' is pressed, reset the password input.
If the pressed key matches the next digit in the password, move to the next position.
If the full password is entered, unlock the door.
###** 8.LockedPosition Function:

LockedPosition(int locked): Locks or unlocks the door based on the locked parameter.
In short, the code uses a keypad to enter a password. When the correct password is entered, it unlocks the door by controlling a lock connected to the Arduino.
